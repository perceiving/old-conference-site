# Perceiving at a distance

## 8-10 June 2016, Antwerp

### Deadline 12 Feb. 2016

We would like to invite you to contribute a paper to a two-day conference on the philosophy of the distal senses. 

The conference focuses on the distal senses, such as vision and audition. Reflection on the capacity to perceive things at a distance gives reason to doubt that sensory experience can be adequately explained in terms of the mechanistic metaphysics that underpins currently popular models of the mind. The conference and associated masterclass will examine alternative positions that can be adopted to make better sense of distal perception. We are seeking contributions that exemplify how cutting-edge research on perception can thrive when resisting a simple-minded, mechanistic view of the mind’s place in nature. 

The conference will take place on Thursday 9th June and Friday 10th June 2016, at the Centre for Philosophical Psychology, University of Antwerp, Belgium. An associated Masterclass for graduate students will take place one day earlier, on the 8th of June; a call for graduate students to take part in the masterclass will be made separately. Keynote speakers will be announced shortly.

We invite submissions for a __20 minute presentation__ followed by a 10-minute discussion. Submitted contributions may be on any issue falling within the conference theme, broadly construed. Topics may include: 

- The relation between optics and vision 
- Presence at a distance
- The objects of olfaction and audition 
- Sympathy in perception 
- Perceptual activity as a form of extramission
- The time-lag argument against naïve realism
- The possibility of mediated perception
- Sense Data
- Distal perception as a motivation for intentionalism/representationalism
- Transparency and its explanatory status in a theory of perception

The conference is sponsored by the [New Directions in the Study of the Mind](http://www.newdirectionsproject.com) project, a [Templeton Foundation](http://www.templeton.org) funded initiative led by Tim Crane at Cambridge University.
