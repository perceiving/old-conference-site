# Perceiving at a Distance

## 9-10 June 2016, Antwerp

The call for abstracts has now closed. Thank you for your submissions.

The conference focuses on the distal senses, such as vision and audition. Reflection on the capacity to perceive things at a distance gives reason to doubt that sensory experience can be adequately explained in terms of the mechanistic metaphysics that underpins currently popular models of the mind. The conference will examine alternative positions that can be adopted to make better sense of distal perception. We are seeking contributions that exemplify how cutting-edge research on perception can thrive when resisting a simple-minded, mechanistic view of the mind’s place in nature. 

The conference will take place on Thursday the 9th and Friday the 10th of June 2016, at the Centre for Philosophical Psychology, University of Antwerp, Belgium. 

Keynote speakers:

- Louise Richardson (York)
- Mark Eli Kalderon (UCL)
- John Campbell (UC Berkeley)

We invite submissions for __20 minute presentations__ followed by a 10-minute discussion. Submitted contributions may be on any issue falling within the conference theme, broadly construed. Topics may include: 

- The relation between optics and vision 
- Presence at a distance
- The objects of olfaction and audition 
- Sympathy in perception 
- The time-lag argument against naïve realism
- The possibility of mediated perception
- Sense Data
- Distal perception as a motivation for intentionalism/representationalism
- Transparency and its explanatory status in a theory of perception

The conference is sponsored by the [New Directions in the Study of the Mind](http://www.newdirectionsproject.com) project, a [Templeton Foundation](http://www.templeton.org) funded initiative led by Tim Crane at Cambridge University.

For further information, please contact one of the conference organisers, Maarten Steenhagen (maarten.steenhagen@uantwerpen.be) and Winnie Sung (whcsung@ntu.edu.sg).
